Hello there! I'm Kehang Zhu, a third year PhD student in Harvard Physics Department. I've been jointly advised by [Prof. John Horton](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/) from [MIT Sloan's IT group](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/faculty-research-centers) and [Prof. David Parkes](https://parkes.seas.harvard.edu/) from Harvard's [EconCS group](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/).


## My Research
I am generally interested in modelling human behaviors.

In the short term,, I am exploring these two directions:
1. Do Language Models(LMs) behave like humans? How? When?
2. Do humans behave like LMs? How can we use LMs to inform new machenism design.

Looking ahead, my long-term scope concerning two questions:
1. How can AI enhance our understanding of ourselves and our intrinsic nature?
2. How can AI be leveraged to foster a more enlightened and equitable society?

### Working paper: 

**[Automated Social Science: Language Models as Scientist and Subjects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11794.)**

<!-- Recently, I was selected as the Introduction to Technical AI Safety Fellow with the [AI Safety Student Team](https://haist.ai/) -->

<!-- Don't hesitate to email me if you are interested in research opportunities or want to collaborate. I constantly mentor undergrad and grad students from Harvard, MIT and other schools. -->

## My Journey So Far

Before joining Harvard, I was very lucky, undeservedly so, to be host by Nobel Laureate in Physics [Prof. Frank Wilczek](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/frank-wilczek/) in MIT. I was working on using Quantum field theory to model complicated dynamics inside a class of material (quantum spin ice) [News](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/K51.5).

My modelling interests turned to human and society after an enriching collaboration with [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/hanspeter-pfister) from Harvard [Viusal Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/). I ran large-scale human-subject studies to investigate the mental models of people making sense of visualizations [CHI 24'](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2024/program/content/147374).


## A Pinch of Extra

When I'm not geeking out over research, you can find me capturing the world through my camera lens ðŸ“¸, embracing the beauty of nature ðŸŒ², hitting the ski slopes ðŸŽ¿, or trekking through scenic trails ðŸ¥¾.
