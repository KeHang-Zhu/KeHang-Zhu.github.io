🌟 Hello there! I'm Kehang Zhu 🌟

Currently, I'm diving deep into my third year of PhD studies at [Harvard University's esteemed Physics Department](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/). Imagine blending the magic of Large Language Models with the intricacies of Economics and Social Science – that's what I'm up to! 🎩✨

I've been incredibly lucky to have some amazing guides on this journey, jointly advised by [Prof. John Horton](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/) from [MIT Sloan's IT group](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/faculty-research-centers) and [Prof. David Parkes](https://parkes.seas.harvard.edu/) from Harvard's [EconCS group](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/).


## 🚀 My Work and Research 🚀

In the short term, I am dedicated to constructing a sandbox environment powered by large language models. This innovative platform will serve as a testing ground for a variety of socio-economic experiments,

Looking ahead, my long-term scope concerning two questions:
1. How can AI enhance our understanding of ourselves and our intrinsic nature?
2. How can AI be leveraged to foster a more enlightened and equitable society?

Recently, I was selected as the Introduction to Technical AI Safety Fellow with the [AI Safety Student Team](https://haist.ai/)

Don't hesitate to email me if you are interested in research opportunities or want to collaborate. I constantly mentor undergrad and grad students from Harvard, MIT and other schools.

## 🎓 My Journey So Far 🎓

My academic voyage started with a B.A. in Physics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), where I was elated to graduate with the highest honors,  both within the department and across the university!

Before joining Harvard, I was very lucky, undeservedly so, to be a visiting scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this period, I was profoundly honored to work under the guidance of Nobel Laureate [Prof. Frank Wilczek](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/frank-wilczek/), whose intellectual prowess has been a beacon of inspiration for me. 

I am also deeply grateful for the enriching collaboration with [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/hanspeter-pfister) from Harvard [Viusal Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), in the fields of visualization and human-computer interaction (HCI).


## 🍃 A Pinch of Extra 🍃

When I'm not geeking out over research, you can find me capturing the world through my camera lens 📸, embracing the beauty of nature 🌲, hitting the ski slopes 🎿, or trekking through scenic trails 🥾.
