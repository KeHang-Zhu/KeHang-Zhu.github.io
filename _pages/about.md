🌟 Hello there! I'm Kehang Zhu 🌟

Currently, I'm diving deep into my third year of PhD studies at [Harvard University's esteemed Physics Department](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/). Imagine blending the magic of Large Language Models with the intricacies of Economics and Social Science – that's what I'm up to! 🎩✨

I've been incredibly lucky to have some amazing guides on this journey. [Prof. John Horton](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/) from [MIT Sloan's IT group](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/faculty-research-centers) and [Prof. David Parkes](https://parkes.seas.harvard.edu/) from Harvard's [EconCS group](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/) have been lighting up my path.

Lately, I've been delving into the fascinating world of Complexity and Adaptive Systems. There's nothing like using modeling and coding to unravel the mysteries behind econ-socio phenomena. It's like solving a puzzle, and I'm here for it! 🧩

## 🚀 My Work and Research 🚀

My research sails across two exciting domains: 
1. Crafting a sandbox where we can 'physicalize' social science experiments! 🏖️
2. Unveiling the immense capabilities of generative AI, with a special shoutout to our big friend, Large Language Models. 🤖

But wait, there's more! My research also dances around:
- Large Language Model development and applications
- Merging Computational Economics with Social Science
- Exploring Complexity and Adaptive Systems

Don't hesitate to email me if you are interested in research opportunities or want to collaborate. I constantly mentor undergrad and grad students from Harvard, MIT and other schools.

## 🎓 My Journey So Far 🎓

My academic voyage started with a B.A. in Physics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), where I was elated to graduate with the highest honors,  both within the department and across the university!

Before joining Harvard, I was very lucky, undeservedly so, to be a visiting scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this period, I was profoundly honored to work under the guidance of Nobel Laureate [Prof. Frank Wilczek](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/frank-wilczek/), whose intellectual prowess has been a beacon of inspiration for me. 

I am also deeply grateful for the enriching collaboration with [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/hanspeter-pfister) from Harvard [Viusal Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), a luminary in the fields of visualization and human-computer interaction.


## 🍃 A Pinch of Extra 🍃

When I'm not geeking out over research, you can find me capturing the world through my camera lens 📸, embracing the beauty of nature 🌲, hitting the ski slopes 🎿, or trekking through scenic trails 🥾.
